------------------------------------------------------------------

o Execute "**RUN_PROJECT**" Jupiter Notebook file under all the projects sections to go through the code.

o Following are the Project's Descriptions: 
- Business Expansion Forecast - Linear Regression
- Mushroom Classifier - Decision Tree with Markdown
- Student Admission Predictor - Logistic Regression.
- Manufacturing QA Predictor - Regularized Logistic Regression
- Hand-written Digits Recognition
      a) Digits(0-1) Classifier - Neural Networks
      b) Digits(0-9) Classifier - Softmax & Neural Networks
- Algorithm Evaluation (Learning Curves and other Relevant diagnostic techniques to evaluate Model's Bias / Variance / Performance).
- Image Compression and Restoration - K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Anomalous behavior in server computers - Anomaly Detection; Working with Skewed Unlabled data along with Error metrics for skewed classes evaluation
- Movie Recommender System:
      a) Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
      b) Content based Filtering Algorithm
- Reinforcement Learning

o Learning Topics covered without Projects Implementation:
> Stochastic Gradient Descent for Large Scale Machine Learning
> Mini-Batch Gradient Descent for Large Scale Machine Learning
> Map Reduce and Data Parallelism for Large Scale Machine Learning
> Problem description and Pipeline; Ceiling Analysis (Error Estimate due to each Pipeline Component)
> Application Example: Photo OCR - Sliding Window Detection
> Artificial Data Synthesis (Applicable upon certain Special Cases like ex - Character Recognization, Audio Recognization etc..)
