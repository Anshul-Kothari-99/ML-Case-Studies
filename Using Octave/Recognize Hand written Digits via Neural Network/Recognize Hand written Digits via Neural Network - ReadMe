To Recognize / predict the Hand written Digits. 

Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks.

The file ex4data1.mat contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits(from 0 to 9) where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. 
Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. 
The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector. 
Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix X. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix X where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image

To implement backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.. 
Execute the outline and the framework code through the script ex4.m file. This scripts will set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to functions.

It will Include:
- Visualizing the data
- Model representation
- Feedforward and Regularized Cost Function
- Backpropagation
- Gradient checking
- Regularized Neural Networks
- Learning parameters using fmincg
- Visualizing the hidden layer
