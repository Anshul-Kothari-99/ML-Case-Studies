To apply anomaly detection algorithm to detect failing servers on a network / To detect the anomalous behavior in server computers.

The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server. 
You suspect that the vast majority of the examples are “normal” (non-anomalous) examples of the servers operating normally, but there might also be some examples of servers acting anomalously within this dataset.

The Dataset contains m = 307 examples of how the computers are behaving, and thus have an unlabeled dataset {x(1), . . . , x(m)}.

To use a Gaussian model for detecting anomalous examples in our dataset.. 
Execute the outline and the framework code through the script ex8.m file. This scripts will set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to functions.

This will Include:
- Gaussian distribution Function
- Estimating parameters for our Gaussian Distribution Function
- Selecting the threshold, ε based upon F1 score (Computed using precision and recall) 
- High dimensional dataset - Implementing the anomaly detection algorithm on a much more realistic hence high dimensional dataset where each example is described by 11 features, capturing more properties of compute servers.
