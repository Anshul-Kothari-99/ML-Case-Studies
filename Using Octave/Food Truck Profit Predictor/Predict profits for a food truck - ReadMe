To predict profits for a food truck. 

Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.

The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

To build a linear regression model that helps to select which city to expand to next.. 
Execute the outline and the framework code through the scripts ex1.m file. This scripts will set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to functions.

This will Include:
- Plotting the Data
- Function implementation for Computing the cost J(θ)
- Plot the cost over a 2-dimensional grid of θ0 and θ1 values. Also produce surface and contour plots of J(θ).
- Gradient descent will fit the linear regression parameters θ to our Hypothesis.
- Finally Profit Prediction
