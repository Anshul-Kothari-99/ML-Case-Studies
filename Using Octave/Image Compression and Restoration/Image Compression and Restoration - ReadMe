To Compress and Restore an Image.

Despite the slight loss in picture quality, compression is an extremely powerful tool that helps to optimize the user experience, helps to save space on your hard drive / Servers etc..

To implement the K-means clustering algorithm for image compression. 
In the second part, To implement principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images..

Execute the outline and the framework code through the scripts ex7.m file for K-means clustering algorithm and ex7_pca.m for Principlal Component Analysis for Dimentionality Reduction.
These scripts will set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to functions.

K-means clustering algorithm will include:
- Finding closest centroids
- Computing centroid means
- K-means on example dataset
- Random initialization
- Image compression with K-means
- K-means on pixels
- Image Reconstruction 
- Use your own image

Principal Component Analysis will include:
- Data Visualization
- PCA Implementation
- Dimensionality Reduction with PCA - Projecting data onto the principal components; Reconstructing an approximation of the data; Visualizing the projections;
