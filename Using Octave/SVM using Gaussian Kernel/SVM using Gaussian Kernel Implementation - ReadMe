To use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs. 

Execute the outline and the framework code through the script ex6.m file. This scripts will set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to functions.

This will Include:
- Separating Dataset by a Linear Boundary and try using different values of the C - parameter with SVMs 
- Using SVMs to do Non-Linear Classification with Gaussian Kernel and test the same upon multiple non Linearly Seperable Datasets.
