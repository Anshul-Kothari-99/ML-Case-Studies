To implement the Collaborative Filtering Learning Algorithm to build a recommender system for movies. 

The objective of collaborative filtering is to predict movie ratings for the movies that users have not yet rated. 
This will allow us to recommend the movies with the highest predicted ratings to the user.

The file ex8_movies.mat contains the dataset for our Collaborative Filtering Learning Algorithm providing the variables Y and R.
The matrix Y (a num_movies Ã— num_users matrix) stores the ratings y(i,j) (from 1 to 5). The matrix R is an binary-valued indicator matrix, where R(i, j) = 1 if user j gave a rating to movie i, and R(i, j) = 0 otherwise.
 
Execute the outline and the framework code through the scripts ex8_cofi.m file. This scripts will set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to functions.

This will Include:
- Collaborative Filtering Learning Algorithm implementation - Computing Regularized Cost Function and Gradients
- Gradient Checking - to numerically check the implementation of your gradients.
- Learning movie recommendations
