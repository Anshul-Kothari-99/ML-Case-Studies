Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy. Here we will make an attempt to build our own spam filter using SVMs.

The dataset included for this exercise is based on a a subset of the SpamAssassin Public Corpus. For the purpose of this exercise, we will only be using the body of the email (excluding the email headers).

To build our own spam filter using SVMs.. 
Execute the outline and the framework code through the script ex6 spam.m file. This scripts will set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to functions.

This will Include:
- Preprocessing Emails
- Vocabulary List - to choose words we would like to use for our classifier.
- Extracting Features from Emails - Whether the featured word in the dictionary occurs in the email.
- Training SVM for Spam Classification
