My Data-Science (Machine Learning) - Learning Journey in Sequence
------------------------------------------------------------------

o Following are the Project's Descriptions: 
1. Food Truck Profit Predictor - Linear Regression with one Variable.
2. House Price Prediction - Linear Regression with Multiple Variables.
3. Admission Predictor - Logistic Regression.
4. Manufacturing Plant Quality Predictor - Regularized Logistic Regression.
5. Recognize Hand-Written Digits - One-vs-All (Multi-Class) Logistic Regression || Neural Networks.
6. Recognize Hand written Digits via Neural Networks - Regularized Neural Network's Model Implementation (Model Training using Feed Forward and Back Propagation).
7. Model Selection - Learning Algorithm Evaluation and Debugging (Learning Curves and other Relevant diagnostic techniques to evaluate Model's Bias / Variance / Performance).
8. SVM using Gaussian Kernels - Gaining intiution of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and experimenting how to use a Linear OR Gaussian kernel with SVMs.
9. Spam Classification - Using SVMs to build our own spam filter; Working with Skewed data along with Error metrics for skewed classes evaluation.
10. Image Compression and Restoration:
      a) Using K-Means: Clustering Algorithm
      b) Using Principal Component Analysis (PCM): For high order Dimentionality Reduction with Max Variance Retained.
11. Anomaly Detection - Anomaly Detection; Working with Skewed Unlabled data along with Error metrics for skewed classes evaluation
12. Movie Recommender System - Collaborative Filtering Learning Algorithm

o Learning Topics covered without Projects Implementation:
