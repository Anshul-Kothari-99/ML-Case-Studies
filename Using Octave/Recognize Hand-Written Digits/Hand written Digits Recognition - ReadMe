To Recognize / predict the Hand written Digits. 

Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks.

The file ex3data1.mat contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits(from 0 to 9) where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. 
Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. 
The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector. 
Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix X. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix X where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image

To implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.. 
Execute the outline and the framework code through the scripts ex3.m file for one-vs-all logistic regression and ex3_nn.m for neural networks. This scripts will set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to functions.

One-vs-All Logistic Regression will include:
- Visualizing the data
- Function vectorized implementation for Computing the cost J(θ)
- Function vectorized implementation for finding the parameter θ through Gradient Descent (Regularized).
- One-vs-all Classification Model Training
- One-vs-all Prediction

Neural Networks will include:
- Model representation
- Feedforward Propagation and Prediction
